# Tricky_Small_Pyhton_Codes
This repository contains regularly asked, small and tricky python codes.

This python file allows you to open a new terminal (child terminal) from current terminal, running python script/file. The newly opened terminal will run a new file/execute a command (if you pass arguments to run a file / execute a command).

Once the file is run/command is executed in the child terminal, you can specifically configure what to do afterwards (close the child terminal/hold). For that go to terminal->preferences and then on the left you see there is a unnamed tag, under which select appropriate option. I have attached a screenshot for your better understandings.
